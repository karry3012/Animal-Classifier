# Animal-Classifier

Overview
EcoVision Pro is a machine learning project designed to classify animal species from images using deep learning techniques. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning (VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet) to accurately classify animals into various species. The goal is to create a robust model capable of identifying animals based on image data, and to provide an interactive user interface using Streamlit for seamless predictions.

Key Features
Transfer Learning with VGG16: Utilizes VGG16, a pre-trained model with ImageNet weights, to improve accuracy and speed up the training process.
Batch Prediction: Supports batch image uploads for quicker predictions.
Performance Monitoring: Tracks performance with early stopping and validation metrics.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and model development.
TensorFlow & Keras: Deep learning libraries used for building, training, and deploying CNN and VGG16 models.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing such as resizing and converting image formats.
NumPy: Numerical computing library for handling image arrays.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image manipulation and preprocessing.
Streamlit: Framework to create the interactive web application for model deployment.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and analysis of model performance metrics.

Dataset
The model is trained on the Animal10 dataset, which includes images from 10 different animal classes such as:

Cat
Dog
Elephant
Horse
Chicken
Butterfly
Cow
Sheep
Squirrel
Spider

Model Architectures

VGG16 Transfer Learning
The model also uses the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, for transfer learning:

Base Model: VGG16 with frozen layers.
Custom Head: A fully connected layer added to fine-tune the model for the specific animal classification task.
Softmax Output: For final classification of 10 animal classes.


Future Enhancements
Model Optimization: Further tuning of the CNN architecture for higher accuracy.
Additional Classes: Expand the dataset to classify more species.
Deployment: Plan to deploy the model.
Model Explainability: Use Grad-CAM or other techniques to explain model predictions.

Conclusion
Animal-Classifier is a comprehensive solution for animal species classification using deep learning. This project demonstrates the power of CNN and Transfer Learning (VGG16) in real-world image classification tasks.
